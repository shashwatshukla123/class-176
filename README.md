Mad Libs are stories with words removed and replaced by blank spaces. One player acts as the “reader” and asks the other players, who haven’t seen the story, to fill in the blanks with adjectives, nouns, exclamations, colors, adjectives, and more. These words are inserted into the blanks and then the story is read aloud to hilarious results.

tag. tags are similar to

tags, but the only difference is that tags are inline tags while
tags are block tags. This means that if we use two
tags, it will be displayed in two different lines, but two tags can be displayed side by side. In our case, we are using the tag in between the text. With this, we can provide a class or an id to our dashes (_____), to refer to these in between items later without affecting all the other text around it.
